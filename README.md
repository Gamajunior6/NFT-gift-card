Good afternoon fellas, here again with another new challenge i set for myself, lets see how long its going to take me.

Good day fellas, today 17th june, 2022, i finished the new first project challenge i set for myself. It took me 1wk+, with miscounted days. 

I made the project with only HTML and CSS, for desktop.

I had help from googling especially the "overlay" it gave me a little headache, i also had a help from an experienced friends, which i was lucky to have in the journey. 

He actually advised me to take on many projects, that i shouldn't be moving fast without a concrete foundation on whatever language i find myself learning, prior to that i told him that i was good in css and he asked me to show him the projects i worked on, which was only one. He said, that is not enough to make you good, you need to code as many project to get concrete foundation. i thank him for that advise, if not for that i wound'nt know my flaws and i will also not know that i was'nt that good enough yet, as i gave myself credit.
